- **Background Monitoring**: Wind effects use efficient heartbeat monitoring

### Customization Options
```lua
-- Wind speed threshold (when effects start)
local WIND_SPEED_THRESHOLD = 20

-- Jump animation height
local jumpHeight = 5

-- Particle rates and lifetimes
sparkles.Rate = success and 80 or 40
sparkles.Lifetime = NumberRange.new(0.8, 1.5)
```

## 🔧 API Reference

### Main Methods
- `PolishController:Init()` - Initialize the polish system
- `PolishController:TogglePolish(enabled)` - Enable/disable all polish effects
- `PolishController:TriggerJumpAnimation()` - Manually trigger jump animation
