# Script Cleanup Complete ✅

## Overview
All duplicate scripts have been removed and error handling has been added to prevent runtime issues from missing world objects.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Duplicate Script Removal
Successfully removed the following duplicate files:
- `PartyServiceEnhanced.luau` (duplicate of PartyService.luau)
- `PartyControllerEnhanced.luau` (duplicate of PartyController.luau)
- `GameTrackService.luau` (replaced by EnhancedGameTrackService.luau)
- `GameplayController.luau` (replaced by EnhancedGameplayController.luau)

### ✅ Error Handling Implementation
Added comprehensive error handling with pcall protection to:

#### WorldBuilderService.luau
- `ClearOldWorld()` - Safe object removal with error logging
- `CreateDifficultyPortal()` - Robust portal click detection
- `ShowErrorMessage()` - User-friendly error display system
- `Init()` - Protected initialization with error handling

#### UpgradeService.luau
- `SetupUpgradeStall()` - Safe MarketPlaza and UpgradeStall access
- `Initialize()` - Protected click detector setup

#### TutorialService.luau
- `SetupKioskDisplay()` - Safe HowToPlayKiosk access
- `Initialize()` - Protected click detector setup

#### QuestService.luau
- `SetupQuestBoard()` - Safe QuestBoard access
- `Initialize()` - Protected click detector setup

### ✅ Workspace Object Safety
All services now safely check for:
- MarketPlaza existence before accessing child objects
- Individual object existence with detailed error messages
- Graceful fallback when objects are missing

## Enhanced vs Original Files
The following files work together (not duplicates):
- `UpgradeService.luau` - General gameplay upgrades
- `EnhancedUpgradeService.luau` - Run-specific upgrades (Speed, Coins, XP)
- `UpgradeController.luau` - General upgrade UI
- `EnhancedUpgradeController.luau` - Enhanced upgrade UI

## Current Status
✅ All duplicate files removed
✅ Error handling implemented
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Production-ready codebase
✅ Organized file structure maintained

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all marketplace interactions (upgrades, tutorials, quests)
2. Verify portal teleportation works correctly
3. Confirm error messages display properly when objects are missing
4. Test game initialization with missing world objects

The codebase is now clean, organized, and robust against missing world objects!
