# Multiplayer Queue System

## ðŸŽ® Overview
The Color Rush game now features an optional multiplayer queue system that allows players to run the track together with up to 5 other players (6 total). The system provides synchronized countdowns, real-time leaderboards, and coordinated gameplay across multiple participants.

## âš¡ How It Works

### Queue System
- **Entry Point**: Players interact with the portal/archway to see game mode options
- **Mode Selection**: Choose between Solo Play or Join Multiplayer Queue
- **Queue Capacity**: Up to 6 players can race together simultaneously
- **Auto-Start**: Queue automatically starts when full or after 30-second timeout
- **Real-Time Updates**: Players see live queue status and participant list

### Synchronized Gameplay
- **Coordinated Start**: All players begin simultaneously with synchronized countdown
- **Track Assignment**: Players are automatically distributed across available tracks
- **Live Leaderboards**: Real-time score updates every 2 seconds during gameplay
- **Collective Results**: Final leaderboard shows all participants' performance

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Queue Management System

#### Queue Data Structure
```lua
multiplayerQueue = {
    [1] = Player1,
    [2] = Player2,
    [3] = Player3,
    -- Up to 6 players total
}
```

#### Session Tracking
```lua
multiplayerSessions[sessionId] = {
    sessionId = "unique_session_id",
    players = {Player1, Player2, Player3},
    startTime = tick(),
    leaderboard = {
        [UserId1] = {player = Player1, score = 15, barriersPassed = 8},
        [UserId2] = {player = Player2, score = 12, barriersPassed = 6}
    },
    isActive = true
}
```

### Core Functions

#### `ArchwayService:AddPlayerToQueue(player)`
- Validates player isn't already queued
- Checks queue capacity (max 6 players)
- Adds player and notifies all participants
- Starts auto-timer for first player
- Auto-launches when queue fills

#### `ArchwayService:StartMultiplayerGame()`
- Creates multiplayer session with unique ID
- Moves all queued players to active session
- Initiates synchronized game sequence
- Assigns players to different tracks

#### `GameService:StartMultiplayerGame(player, sessionId, allPlayers)`
- Creates game session linked to multiplayer session
- Synchronizes starting color across all players
- Begins real-time leaderboard broadcasting
- Tracks multiplayer-specific analytics

### Track Assignment System

#### Available Tracks
```lua
local trackPositions = {
    Vector3.new(100, 6, -10),    -- Track 1 (Original)
    Vector3.new(-100, 6, -10),   -- Track 2 (Original)
    Vector3.new(0, 6, 140),      -- Track 3 (Original)
    Vector3.new(200, 6, -10),    -- Track 4 (New)
    Vector3.new(-200, 6, -10),   -- Track 5 (New)
    Vector3.new(100, 6, 240)     -- Track 6 (New)
}
```

#### Distribution Logic
- Players are assigned using modulo cycling through available tracks
- Ensures even distribution across all 6 possible tracks
- Prevents overcrowding on any single track

## ðŸŽ¯ Player Experience Flow

### Queue Entry Process
1. **Portal Interaction**: Player touches archway trigger zone
2. **Mode Selection**: GUI appears with Solo/Multiplayer options
3. **Queue Join**: Player selects "Join Multiplayer Queue"
4. **Queue Status**: Real-time updates show queue position and participant list
5. **Auto-Start**: Game begins when full or after timeout

### Game Initialization
1. **Synchronized Fade**: All players fade to black simultaneously
2. **Track Assignment**: Players teleported to assigned tracks
3. **Coordinated Countdown**: Synchronized 3-2-1 countdown for all participants
4. **Simultaneous Start**: All players begin racing at the exact same moment

### Live Competition
1. **Real-Time Leaderboard**: Updates every 2 seconds during gameplay
2. **Score Comparison**: Players see live rankings during the race
3. **Individual Progress**: Personal score tracking maintained alongside group stats
4. **Dynamic Rankings**: Leaderboard position changes based on performance

### Results & Completion
1. **Individual Completion**: Players finish at their own pace
2. **Live Updates**: Leaderboard continues updating as players finish
3. **Final Results**: Complete leaderboard shown when all players finish
