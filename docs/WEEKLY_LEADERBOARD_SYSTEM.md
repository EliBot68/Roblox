## Technical Implementation

### Data Architecture
```lua
-- Weekly data structure
{
    weekId = "week_1640995200", -- Unix timestamp of week start
    startTime = 1640995200,     -- Monday 00:00:00 UTC
    endTime = 1641599999,       -- Sunday 23:59:59 UTC
    playerData = {
        [userId] = {
            userId = 12345,
            username = "Player",
            displayName = "Display",
            weeklyCoins = 15750,
            totalGames = 42,
            lastUpdated = 1641234567
        }
    },
    topPlayers = {...} -- Sorted array of top players
}
```

### Reset Logic
- **Week Start Calculation**: Finds Monday 00:00:00 UTC for any given timestamp
- **Automatic Detection**: Checks every minute for week end
- **Archive System**: Saves final results before reset
- **Reward Availability**: Marks reward claims as invalid after reset

### Performance Optimizations
- **Cached Rankings**: Top players cached and updated every 30 seconds
- **Lazy Loading**: Only loads leaderboard data when players view it
- **Efficient Sorting**: Uses table.sort with coin count comparison
- **Minimal DataStore Calls**: Batches updates and saves periodically
