# üéØ Level Progression System Design

## üåü Overview
A comprehensive progression system that guides players from beginner-friendly tracks to expert-level challenges, with clear unlocking mechanics, difficulty scaling, and replay incentives that keep players engaged long-term.

## üóùÔ∏è Unlock Mechanics

### **Primary Progression Currency: XP (Experience Points)**
Experience points create a sense of continuous growth and mastery progression.

#### **XP Sources**
- **Track Completion**: 100-500 XP based on difficulty and performance
- **Skill Demonstrations**: 25-100 XP for perfect timing, combos, risk-taking
- **Daily Challenges**: 200-1000 XP for completing specific objectives
- **First-Time Bonuses**: 2x XP for completing new tracks for first time
- **Mastery Achievements**: 500-2000 XP for perfect runs or collection goals

#### **XP Calculation Formula**
```
Base XP = Track Difficulty √ó 100
Performance Multiplier = (Score / Perfect Score) √ó 2.0
Completion Bonus = Track Completed ? 100 : 0
Final XP = (Base XP √ó Performance Multiplier) + Completion Bonus + Skill Bonuses
```

### **Secondary Currency: Coins**
Coins provide immediate unlocking power for impatient players and monetization opportunities.

#### **Coin Unlock Costs**
- **Easy Tracks**: 1,000-2,500 coins (achievable through gameplay)
