### Step 4: Enable Required Services
1. In Roblox Studio, go to Game Settings
2. Navigate to Security tab
3. Enable "Allow HTTP Requests" (for analytics)
4. Ensure "Allow Third Party Sales" is enabled (should be by default)

### Step 5: Test the Implementation
1. Publish your game to Roblox
2. Test in the actual Roblox client (not Studio)
3. Try purchasing both the gamepass and developer product
4. Verify that:
   - VIP gamepass provides 2x coin multiplier permanently
   - 100 Coins Pack adds 100 coins to player balance
   - Purchases are saved to DataStore
   - Analytics track the purchases

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **Purchases not working in Studio**: Monetization only works in published games
2. **IDs not found**: Double-check you copied the correct IDs from the store URLs
3. **Gamepass not applying**: Check server console for MarketplaceService errors
4. **Developer product not processing**: Verify ProcessReceipt function is working

#### Testing Commands:
Add these to your game for testing (remove in production):
```lua
-- In server script, add admin commands
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    player.Chatted:Connect(function(message)
        if player.Name == "YourUsername" then -- Replace with your username
            if message:lower() == "/test vip" then
                MonetizationService:ApplyGamepassBenefits(player)
            elseif message:lower() == "/add coins" then
                local data = PlayerService:GetPlayerData(player)
                data.coins = data.coins + 100
                PlayerService:UpdatePlayerData(player, data)
            end
        end
    end)
end)
```

### Revenue Optimization Tips

1. **Gamepass Pricing**: Start with 25-50 Robux, can increase based on demand
2. **Developer Product Pricing**: Price competitively - 100 coins for ~100 Robux
3. **Bundle Offers**: Consider creating larger coin packs (500 coins, 1000 coins)
4. **Limited Time Offers**: Create seasonal or special event gamepasses
5. **VIP Benefits**: Consider adding more VIP benefits (exclusive skins, faster movement, etc.)

### Analytics Data
The system automatically tracks:
- Gamepass and developer product purchases
- Revenue per player
- Purchase conversion rates
- Player lifetime value

Use this data to optimize pricing and create targeted offers.

### Security Notes
- Never trust client-side purchase validation
- Always validate purchases on the server
- Store sensitive data (API keys) securely
- Monitor for unusual purchase patterns

### Next Steps
1. Set up your analytics endpoint (see ANALYTICS_README.md)
2. Create promotional materials for your gamepasses
3. Monitor player feedback and purchase rates
4. Consider A/B testing different prices
5. Add more monetization options based on player behavior
