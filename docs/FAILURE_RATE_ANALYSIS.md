## 🔥 Critical Failure Alert System

### **Immediate Action Required (>90% Fail Rate)**
```lua
-- Auto-generated alerts for critical failures
CRITICAL_ALERT = {
    failureRate = 92,
    location = "Early Game Barriers 8-12",
    platform = "Mobile",
    timeOfDay = "Evening",
    affectedPlayers = 450,
    recommendedAction = "EMERGENCY: Reduce barrier 8-12 difficulty by 40%",
    estimatedImpact = "High player churn risk"
}
```

### **High Priority (80-90% Fail Rate)**
- Schedule difficulty adjustment within 24 hours
- Monitor closely for escalation
- Consider A/B testing solutions

### **Medium Priority (70-80% Fail Rate)**
- Plan adjustment in next update cycle
- Gather additional player feedback
- Test alternative approaches

## 📈 Real-Time Monitoring Commands

        barrierFrequency = 1.0,
        colorComplexity = 1.0
    }
    
    -- Platform-based adjustments
    if platform == "mobile" and self:GetPlatformFailRate("mobile") > 70 then
        adjustment.speedMultiplier = 0.85 -- Slower on mobile
        adjustment.barrierFrequency = 0.9  -- Fewer barriers
    end
    
    -- Time-based adjustments
    if timeOfDay == "night" and self:GetTimeFailRate("night") > 75 then
        adjustment.speedMultiplier = 0.9   -- Slower at night
        adjustment.colorComplexity = 0.8   -- Simpler patterns
    end
