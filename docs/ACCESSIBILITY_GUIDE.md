# Xbox Controller & Colorblind Accessibility Guide

## Overview

Color Rush now includes comprehensive accessibility features designed to make the game more inclusive for all players. These features include Xbox controller support with D-pad controls and a colorblind mode that uses symbols to differentiate colors.

## üéÆ Xbox Controller Support

### D-Pad Controls
The Xbox controller D-pad provides intuitive color switching:

- **D-Pad Up** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = Red Color
- **D-Pad Left** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è = Green Color  
- **D-Pad Right** ‚û°Ô∏è = Blue Color

### Thumbstick Support
For additional accessibility, the left thumbstick also supports color selection:

- **Thumbstick Up** = Red Color
- **Thumbstick Left** = Green Color
- **Thumbstick Right/Down** = Blue Color

### Enabling Controller Support
1. Connect an Xbox controller to your device
2. Press `\` (backslash) or `ESC` to open Settings
3. Toggle "Controller Support" to ON
4. The controller will automatically work when connected

## üî§ Colorblind Mode

### Symbol System
When colorblind mode is enabled, each color is represented by a unique symbol:

- **Red** = üî∫ (Triangle)
- **Green** = ‚¨ü (Pentagon)
- **Blue** = ‚¨¢ (Hexagon)
- **Yellow** = ‚≠ê (Star)
- **Purple** = ‚¨• (Diamond)
- **Orange** = ‚¨£ (Rounded Hexagon)

### Visual Features
- **Mobile Controls**: Symbols appear on touch buttons
- **Player Display**: Symbol appears above player's head
- **High Contrast**: Symbols use white text with black outlines for visibility
- **Animations**: Symbols pulse gently to draw attention

### Enabling Colorblind Mode

2. Toggle "Colorblind Mode" to ON
3. Symbols will immediately appear in the game

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Menu

### Settings Persistence
All accessibility settings are automatically saved to your player data and persist across game sessions.

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Controller Input Detection
```lua
-- D-pad input handling
if input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.DPadUp then
    self:HandleColorChange("RED")
elseif input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.DPadLeft then
    self:HandleColorChange("GREEN")
elseif input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.DPadRight then
    self:HandleColorChange("BLUE")
end
```

### Symbol Display System
```lua
-- Colorblind symbol constants
GameConstants.COLORBLIND_SYMBOLS = {
    RED = "üî∫",   -- Triangle
    GREEN = "‚¨ü", -- Pentagon  
    BLUE = "‚¨¢",  -- Hexagon
    YELLOW = "‚≠ê", -- Star
    PURPLE = "‚¨•", -- Diamond
    ORANGE = "‚¨£"  -- Rounded hexagon
}
```

### Settings Data Structure
```lua
playerData.settings = {
    music = true,
    sfx = true,
    colorblindMode = false,
    controllerEnabled = true
}
```

## üìä Analytics & Tracking

### Accessibility Metrics
The system tracks accessibility feature usage for improvement:

- **Setting Changes**: When players enable/disable features
- **Controller Usage**: Frequency of controller vs keyboard input
- **Symbol Effectiveness**: Player performance with colorblind mode

### Privacy
All analytics data is anonymized and used solely for improving accessibility features.

## üîß Configuration Options

### For Developers
Settings can be configured in `GameConstants.luau`:

```lua
-- Controller Settings
GameConstants.CONTROLLER_ENABLED = true
GameConstants.DPAD_COLORS = {"RED", "GREEN", "BLUE"}

-- Colorblind Symbols (customizable)
GameConstants.COLORBLIND_SYMBOLS = {
    RED = "üî∫",
    GREEN = "‚¨ü", 
    BLUE = "‚¨¢"
    -- Add more as needed
}
```

### Default Settings
New players start with these accessibility defaults:
- Controller Support: **Enabled**
- Colorblind Mode: **Disabled**
- Music: **Enabled**
- Sound Effects: **Enabled**

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Content Creators
1. **Accessibility Awareness**: Mention accessibility features in tutorials
2. **Inclusive Language**: Use descriptive terms beyond just colors
3. **Visual Clarity**: Ensure accessibility features are visible in recordings

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Controller Not Working
1. Verify controller is properly connected to device
2. Check "Controller Support" is enabled in settings
