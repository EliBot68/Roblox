# Game Analytics & Balancing System

## 📊 Overview
Comprehensive analytics system that tracks key metrics for game balancing and monetization optimization. Provides real-time insights for difficulty tuning and store optimization.

## 🎯 Core Metrics Tracked

### **1. Average Session Time**
- **Definition**: Time from player join to player leave
- **Purpose**: Measure player engagement and retention
- **Targets**: 
  - Healthy: 10-30 minutes
  - Warning: <5 minutes (poor retention)
  - Excellent: >45 minutes (high engagement)

### **2. Coins Earned Per Run**
- **Definition**: Average coins collected per completed run
- **Purpose**: Balance economy and progression pace
- **Targets**:
  - Beginner: 50-100 coins
  - Intermediate: 100-200 coins  
  - Advanced: 200+ coins
  - With Gamepass: 2x multiplier

### **3. Fail Rate Per Barrier**
- **Definition**: Percentage of barriers where players fail to match colors
- **Purpose**: Identify difficulty spikes and balance barriers
- **Targets**:
  - Optimal: 20-40% fail rate
  - Too Easy: <20% (add challenge)
  - Too Hard: >70% (reduce difficulty)

### **4. Gamepass Usage Percentage**
- **Definition**: Percentage of players who own and use gamepasses
- **Purpose**: Measure monetization effectiveness
- **Targets**:
  - Baseline: 5-15% adoption
  - Good: 15-25% adoption
  - Excellent: 25%+ adoption

### **5. Bounce Rate**
- **Definition**: Percentage of players who leave without starting a run
- **Purpose**: Measure onboarding effectiveness
- **Targets**:
  - Acceptable: <20% bounce rate
  - Warning: 20-40% bounce rate
  - Critical: >40% bounce rate

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Session Tracking System**
```lua
sessionMetrics[player.UserId] = {
    sessionStart = joinTime,
    runsCompleted = 0,
    totalCoinsEarned = 0,
    totalBarriersAttempted = 0,
    totalBarriersFailed = 0,
    hasGamepass = false,
    gamepassesOwned = {},
    firstRunStarted = false,
    bounced = false,
    barrierFailsByType = {}, -- Position + color tracking
    coinsPerRun = {}, -- Individual run tracking
    perfectRuns = 0,
    interactionCount = 0
}
```

### **Difficulty Analysis**
- **Barrier Position Tracking**: Identifies which barriers cause most failures
- **Color Pattern Analysis**: Tracks which color combinations are hardest
- **Learning Curve Measurement**: Compares early vs late performance
- **Difficulty Spike Detection**: Automatically flags problematic barriers

### **Monetization Analytics**
- **Gamepass Ownership Tracking**: Who owns what and when they purchased
- **Value Realization**: How much benefit players get from purchases
- **Usage Frequency**: How often gamepass benefits are utilized
- **Purchase Funnel**: Where players drop off in purchase flow

## 📈 Real-Time Insights

### **Balancing Recommendations**
```lua
-- Automatic difficulty recommendations
if failRate > 70 then
    recommendation = "CRITICAL: Reduce difficulty immediately"
elseif failRate < 20 then
    recommendation = "Consider adding more challenge"
end

-- Session engagement warnings
if avgSessionTime < 300 then
    recommendation = "ENGAGEMENT: Improve early game hooks"
end

-- Monetization insights
if gamepassAdoption < 10 then
    recommendation = "LOW: Improve gamepass value proposition"
end
```

## Event Types Tracked

| Event Type | Description | Data Fields |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `run_start` | Player starts a game run | startColor, startTime |
| `barrier_match` | Player successfully matches barrier color | barrierColor, playerColor, newScore, barriersPassed |
| `barrier_miss` | Player hits wrong color barrier | barrierColor, playerColor, newScore, penalty |

## Data Transmission

- **Automatic Flush**: Every 5 minutes or when buffer reaches 100 events
- **Player Leave Flush**: Immediate flush when a player disconnects
- **Batch Size**: 50 events per HTTP request (configurable)
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per HTTP request
- **Retry Logic**: Failed requests are logged but not retried (implement on your endpoint)

## Admin Commands (Development)

For testing purposes, you can use these chat commands (admin only):

- `/analytics flush` - Manually flush the analytics buffer
- `/analytics status` - Display current analytics status
- `/analytics toggle` - Enable/disable analytics transmission

**Important**: Remove or restrict these commands in production!

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key**: Store your API key securely and rotate it regularly
2. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS endpoints for data transmission
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on your analytics endpoint
4. **Data Validation**: Validate all incoming data on your server
5. **Player Privacy**: Ensure compliance with privacy laws (GDPR, COPPA, etc.)

## Performance Impact

The analytics system is designed to be lightweight:
- Events are buffered in memory (minimal RAM usage)
- HTTP requests are sent asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Failed requests don't retry automatically (prevents cascading failures)
- Buffer is automatically managed to prevent memory leaks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **HTTP requests failing**
   - Check if your game has HTTP requests enabled in Roblox Studio
   - Verify your endpoint URL and API key
   - Ensure your server accepts the required headers

2. **No events being sent**
   - Check if analytics is enabled: `AnalyticsService:GetConfiguration()`
   - Verify the buffer has events: `AnalyticsService:GetAnalyticsSummary()`
   - Check server output for error messages

3. **Events missing data**
   - Some events depend on service initialization order
   - Ensure all services are properly connected in `init.server.luau`

### Debug Mode

To enable verbose logging, add this to your server startup:

```lua
-- Enable debug mode for analytics
AnalyticsService:ConfigureEndpoint(nil, nil, false) -- Disable HTTP to test locally
```

## Example Analytics Service Setup

Here's a simple Node.js/Express endpoint example:

```javascript
app.post('/api/events', (req, res) => {
    const { gameId, gameVersion, timestamp, eventCount, events } = req.body;
    
    // Validate API key
    const apiKey = req.headers.authorization?.replace('Bearer ', '');
    if (apiKey !== process.env.ANALYTICS_API_KEY) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid API key' });
    }
    
    // Process events
    console.log(`Received ${eventCount} events from ${gameId} v${gameVersion}`);
    
    // Store in your database
    events.forEach(event => {
        // Save to database
        database.analytics.insert(event);
    });
    
    res.json({ received: eventCount, processed: true });
});
```

## Data Analysis Ideas

With this analytics data, you can track:

- **Player Engagement**: Session duration, frequency of play
- **Game Balance**: Success rates on different barrier colors
- **Monetization**: Shop purchase patterns and conversion rates
- **Player Progression**: Score improvements over time
- **Retention**: Player return patterns and churn analysis
- **Performance**: Average game duration and completion rates

## Support

For issues with the analytics system, check the server console for error messages and ensure your endpoint meets the requirements above.
