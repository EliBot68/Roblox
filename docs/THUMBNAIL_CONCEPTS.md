## 🛠️ **Implementation in Roblox Studio**

### 📸 **Camera Setup Script**
```lua
-- Thumbnail Camera Controller
local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable

-- Action Shot Camera
local function setupActionCamera(character)
    local primaryPart = character.PrimaryPart
    local cameraOffset = Vector3.new(5, -2, 8)
    camera.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(
        primaryPart.Position + cameraOffset,
        primaryPart.Position
    )
    camera.FieldOfView = 75
end
```

### 💡 **Lighting Setup Script**
```lua
-- Professional Lighting Setup
local function setupThumbnailLighting()
    -- Remove default lighting
    game.Lighting.Ambient = Color3.new(0.1, 0.1, 0.15)
    game.Lighting.Brightness = 0
    
    -- Key light
    local keyLight = Instance.new("SunRaysEffect")
    keyLight.Intensity = 0.8
    keyLight.Spread = 0.1
    keyLight.Parent = game.Lighting
    
    -- Fill lights
    local pointLight = Instance.new("PointLight")
